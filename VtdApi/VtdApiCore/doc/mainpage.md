The VtdApi aims to offer a C++ interface to control and interact with a simulation, and to offer a common codebase for all VTD products and user code in the Form of VTDFramework.

VtdApi offers convenience functions for simulation control both via RDB and SCP. It relies heavily on VTDFramework, which will be the common codebase for future versions of VTD and accompanying samples and tools. Ultimately, it's aim is to increase type safety and decrease the effort required to write code for VTD while providing a common interface throughout.
